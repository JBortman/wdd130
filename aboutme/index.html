    <h2>Jordan Bortman</h2>
    <p> Hello all, my name is Jordan! I am currently working on getting my Bachelor's towards Applied Technology. I
        want to better my current career path and be able to support my family better. I am married to an amazing
        woman and we have one son as of right now. We do wish to have more but our circumstances right now are
        keeping that from happening. I enjoy playing video games with my wife (they range anywhere from Halo, Call
        of Duty, Minecraft, Mario Kart, and everything in between really) as well as playing guitar, bass, and
        drums.</p>
    <p>I am currently working at a masonry company where we build block walls for residential neighborhoods and some
        commercial buildings. I am in the office making sure we have the proper digging permits we need and
        scheduling our digging crews. I've been there for about 6 years now and have had an amazing time. I'm hoping
        after this degree, I will be able to actually start my career from being an administrator to something
        involving computer programming or IT related paths. I'm very interested in learning more about how programs
        and computer work to be able to help others later on.</p>
