                        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                        <p>We are a bunch of guitarists who want to share our love through teaching others. We come from all different walks of life and many different styles of playing. What started off as a group of friends teaching each other their favorite songs, grew into a place where they can now show others their skills and how they learned them. This website is meant to be more than just a bunch of tutorials for playing shapes and chords. These lessons are engaging, informative, but most importantly: FUN! You won’t just know the music, you’ll feel it! We love having anyone log in and check us out, you don’t even need to know how to play! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We love guitar, it’s a big part of who we are. That is why we created this beginner to veteran friendly site. Our instructors and support team are enthusiastic, very welcoming, and cannot wait to spread the love. </p>
