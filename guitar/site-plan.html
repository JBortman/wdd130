      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you want to learn how to play guitar, but don't know where to start? Have you tried to learn but found teachers to be too expensive, boring, or too easy/hard? As a fellow guitar player, I know this struggle. I’ve been playing for 12 years and even I still have so much to learn. On my website, you can find a guitar class tailored to your ability and play style. First time players to professionals, from classical to heavy metal and everything in between!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience I am aiming for is anyone who wants to learn how to play guitar or develop their skills even further. I mainly want to focus on those who are just starting out and want to try guitar. I hope to spark some interest in people and provide them a way to learn in the comfort of their home. Of course I would love to have other players from all sorts of skill levels join in on it as well, there are lessons for everyone. But the main goal is creating a foundation for new players to make their dream of playing guitar a reality.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        We are a bunch of guitarists who want to share our love through teaching others. We come from all different walks of life and many different styles of playing. What started off as a group of friends teaching each other their favorite songs, grew into a place where they can now show others their skills and how they learned them. This website is meant to be more than just a bunch of tutorials for playing shapes and chords. These lessons are engaging, informative, but most importantly: FUN! You won’t just know the music, you’ll feel it! We love having anyone log in and check us out, you don’t even need to know how to play! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We love guitar, it’s a big part of who we are. That is why we created this beginner to veteran friendly site. Our instructors and support team are enthusiastic, very welcoming, and cannot wait to spread the love.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Here, you will learn from the ground up many ways to master your guitar. From basic strumming and pick holding exercises to learning full length songs with breakdowns of each section. Before you know it, you will be jamming along to your favorite songs. You can start your journey off with our guitar foundations classes. You’ll start from scratch learning about the instruments themselves, how to hold them, strumming, and a few different picking techniques. Each class is a set of pre-recorded videos giving instructions and some exercises to do in-between lessons. Kind of like homework, but without the grade. Even if you can only practice for 5-10 minutes a day, you can still take part. Each lesson ends with a “test” for you to show the skill you have just learned. Then, you move on to the next one when YOU are ready to move on. At the very end of each set, there is a song to learn based on the genre you choose to act as a “final exam” where you go step by step through the song, using the techniques you have just learned. Right now, we currently offer blues, rock, and country to start, but we have plans to expand into pop, funk, jazz, and any other genre that has interest. As our knowledge and skills expand, so will the content! Even we are learning new things almost every day!

      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        In order to participate, the first thing you’re going to need is a guitar, if you don’t already have one. It doesn’t need to be a high-end expensive one, any guitar will do. If you need help finding one, ask us! We know of many different affordable, but reliable, brands to look up. Having an amp or a set up on your computer to plug your guitar into is recommended, but not required. It will enhance your experience though and give you ways to personalize your sound! When it comes to picks, we’d recommend using whatever is comfortable with you. Start off with some 0.5mm thick to get started and go from there. If picks aren’t your thing, go ahead and just use your fingers! There are plenty of world famous guitarists who just use their fingers, no one will judge you. Lastly, to get the most out of our lessons you’re going to need the desire to play. Anyone can sign up and take our classes, but without desire these are just a bunch of finger exercises. If you love our beginner classes and want to upgrade to the next level, you will need to prepare to pay for the higher-tier classes. As much as we’d love to give everything for free, lots of work was put into this and we need to compensate our amazing instructors for the work they do.
