      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you want to learn how to play guitar, but don't know where to start? Have you tried to learn but found teachers to be too expensive, boring, or too easy/hard? As a fellow guitar player, I know this struggle. Iâ€™ve been playing for 12 years and even I still have so much to learn. On my website, you can find a guitar class tailored to your ability and play style. First time players to professionals, from classical to heavy metal and everything in between!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience we are aiming for is basically anyone who wants to learn guitar, but we mainly want to focus on those who are just starting out and want to try out guitar. We hope that we can spark some interest and continue to grow the guitar playing community. We of course would love to have other players from all sorts of skill levels join in on it as well, there are courses for everyone. But the main goal is creating a foundation for new players to make their dream of playing guitar a reality.</p>  <!-- change this -->
