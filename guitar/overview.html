            <p>Here, you will learn from the ground up many ways to master your guitar. From basic strumming and pick holding exercises to learning full length songs with breakdowns of each section. Before you know it, you will be jamming along to your favorite songs. You can start your journey off with our guitar foundations classes. You’ll start from scratch learning about the instruments themselves, how to hold them, strumming, and a few different picking techniques. Each class is a set of pre-recorded videos giving instructions and some exercises to do in-between lessons. Kind of like homework, but without the grade. Even if you can only practice for 5-10 minutes a day, you can still take part. Each lesson ends with a “test” for you to show the skill you have just learned. Then, you move on to the next one when YOU are ready to move on. At the very end of each set, there is a song to learn based on the genre you choose to act as a “final exam” where you go step by step through the song, using the techniques you have just learned. Right now, we currently offer blues, rock, and country to start, but we have plans to expand into pop, funk, jazz, and any other genre that has interest. As our knowledge and skills expand, so will the content! Even we are learning new things almost every day!</p>
