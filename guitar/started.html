            <p>In order to participate, the first thing you’re going to need is a guitar, if you don’t already have one. It doesn’t need to be a high-end expensive one, any guitar will do. If you need help finding one, ask us! We know of many different affordable, but reliable, brands to look up. Having an amp or a set up on your computer to plug your guitar into is recommended, but not required. It will enhance your experience though and give you ways to personalize your sound!</p>

            <p>When it comes to picks, we’d recommend using whatever is comfortable with you. Start off with some 0.5mm thick to get started and go from there. If picks aren’t your thing, go ahead and just use your fingers! There are plenty of world famous guitarists who just use their fingers, no one will judge you. Lastly, to get the most out of our lessons you’re going to need the desire to play. Anyone can sign up and take our classes, but without desire these are just a bunch of finger exercises. If you love our beginner classes and want to upgrade to the next level, you will need to prepare to pay for the higher-tier classes. As much as we’d love to give everything for free, lots of work was put into this and we need to compensate our amazing instructors for the work they do.</p>
